# Computer Graphics Algorithms and Programs

This repository contains various computer graphics algorithms and programs implemented in Java. These programs are essential for understanding basic graphics techniques and transformations. Below is the list of algorithms and tasks implemented:

### 1. [DDALineDrawing](DDALineDrawing.java)
   - Implement the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) line drawing algorithm using Java Swing.

### 2. [BSALineDrawing](BSALineDrawing.java)
   - Implement the Bresenham's Line Algorithm for drawing a line between two points.

### 3. [MidPointCircleDrawing](MidPointCircleDrawing.java)
   - Implement the Mid-Point Circle Drawing Algorithm to draw circles.

### 4. [MidPointEllipseDrawing](MidPointEllipseDrawing.java)
   - Implement the Mid-Point Ellipse Drawing Algorithm to draw ellipses.

### 5. [CohenSutherlandClipping](CohenSutherlandClipping.java)
   - Implement the Cohen Sutherland line clipping algorithm to clip lines based on the window boundaries.

### 6. 2D Transformation of Triangle Polygon
   - **a. [TransformationTriangle](TransformationTriangle.java):** Apply translation, scaling, and rotation transformations on a triangle polygon.
     - **Translation:** Apply translation with a translation vector `tx=2` and `ty=2`.
     - **Scaling:** Apply scaling with scaling factors `sx=2` and `sy=2`.
     - **Rotation:** Apply rotation about the Y-axis by 45 degrees in a counter-clockwise direction.

### 7. [MovingCar](MovingCar.java)
   - Write a program to simulate a car moving from the left corner to the right corner of the screen.

### 8. [BezierCurve](BezierCurve.java)
   - Write a program to draw a Bezier curve using 4 control points.
